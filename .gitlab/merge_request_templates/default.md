### Backporting

#### Timeline
- [ ] **Immediate**: patchset needed as soon as possible
- [ ] **Next Minor Stable Release**: patchset that needs to be verified in nightly before backport
- [ ] **Eventually**: patchset that needs to be verified in alpha before backport
- [ ] **No Backport (preferred)**: patchset for the next major stable

#### (Optional) Justification
- [ ] **Emergency security update**: patchset fixes CVEs, 0-days, etc
- [ ] **Censorship event**: patchset enables censorship circumvention
- [ ] **Critical bug-fix**: patchset fixes a bug in core-functionality
- [ ] **Consistency**: patchset which would make development easier if it were in both the alpha and release branches; developer tools, build system changes, etc
- [ ] **Sponsor required**: patchset required for sponsor
- [ ] **Other**: please explain
