# Large introduction text.
yec-2023-introduction = Right now, Tor Browser is protecting your privacy and the privacy of millions of people like you!
# Follows directly below yec-2023-introduction.
# The <span data-l10n-name="attention"> tag is meant to bring some styling attention to the first phrase, but doesn't have any semantic meaning.
yec-2023-please-donate = <span data-l10n-name="attention">This is possible because of donations from our community.</span> If you value the privacy that Tor Browser offers yourself and others, please make a donation today. You’ll ensure Tor Browser continues to provide online privacy to everyone who needs it.
# Shown only during a period where donations will be matched. The end date should match the end of the year.
# $amount (Number) - The donation limit. This will be a whole-number and will be automatically formatted according to the language/locale: using the language's numeral symbols and thousand-separators.
# NOTE: The amount should be shown as USD (United States dollar) currency. In the original English string, the first "$" is the literal USD currency symbol, and this can be changed or removed when translating to whatever is most appropriate for USD currency in the locale. In contrast, the "$" at the start of "$amount" is part of the Fluent format's syntax and should not be changed when translating.
# For example, "${ $amount }" for English would eventually be shown as "$5,000", whilst "{ $amount } US$" for Arabic would be shown as "٥٬٠٠٠ US$".
# Translators: If you need any help or clarification, feel free to ask a question on weblate or in IRC (#tor-l10n).
